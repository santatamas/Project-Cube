Project Cube
============
While it started as a small LCD-like game for the Android, with the time Project Cube grew something more, serving me as a good place to experiment with different platforms and technologies.
It has a standalone pixelmatrix editor app written in C# (WPF), with GIF conversion feature.
The 'game' has client libraries for iOS (swift + spritekit), Android (libGDX), and Windows (libGDX).
